										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man who says he was stalked for months is sharing his story.</p>
<p>Jonathan DeCastro told News 3 that the stalking he suffered began in 2019 when he still lived in Newport News. Although he wasn&#8217;t with his partner for long, the stalking began when they broke up.</p>
<p>Neisha Himes, the CEO of <a class="Link" href="http://growfoundationva.org/">GROW</a>, an organization that helps domestic violence victims, said she sees cases like this often.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked with at least 50 to 60% stalking cases,&#8221; Himes said. &#8220;[They can range from] harassing phone calls, or a GPS tracker being placed into [the victim&#8217;s] vehicle unwanted.&#8221;</p>
