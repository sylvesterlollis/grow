He was questioning where I had been all day and who I was with. I looked down at my work clothes; biting my trembling bottom lip in frustration. Moving my focus from the ruffles on my favorite green shirt to the tips of my leopard heels, I braced myself for whatever version of war we would engage in next. His words were like bullets, piercing through my skin until they reached the hollow point of what was left of my self-worth. The verbal abuse, which had been going on for two years now, was worse than ever before. It was only so many times that I could hear “dumb bitch”, “worthless whore” or any other colorful and equally disrespectful adjective he so graciously used to describe the woman he swore he loved. Deciding enough was enough, I reached for my purse and began to prepare to leave when he picked up a pillow and started towards me. Swinging the pillow with all of his might, he hauled off and slapped me so hard that he knocked me off of the bed. I don’t know what I felt more, surprise, hurt or rage but whatever it was, I couldn’t do THIS anymore. What happened next is a blur or at least I wish it was. I jumped up, crying and screaming as he charged at me, threw me to the ground and began kicking, hitting and choking me. This went on for what seemed like an eternity but couldn’t have been more than a few minutes. He stopped and looked at me, hazel eyes wide, as I gingerly touched my bruised neck and swollen mouth. I quietly picked up my purse, making sure to tiptoe past the white elephant in the room, and walked out the back door. He followed me, almost in tears himself, and whispered the biggest lie he’d ever said next to “I love you”. He said “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Several years and countless tears later, I will have survived the hell of emotional, verbal and physical abuse at the hands of the man who said he loved me.  I will begin speaking out against this devastating epidemic, vowing to use my pain for the purpose of raising awareness and healing others.  One day, I will walk to my closet and grab the hanger holding the green shirt that was once my favorite. I’ll take a deep breath, thinking briefly about the last time I had worn it (hmmm…with my leopard skirt?) and toss both the hanger and the shirt in the nearest trash can. Looking at the ruffles peeking over the brim, I will close the lid and walk away without looking back. Why should I? It didn’t fit me anymore anyway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember when I was a teenager, maybe 17 or 18 years old, hearing about abuse and saying something like “I wish a man <em>WOULD</em> try and put his hands on me. I’d leave, no questions.”</p>
<p>I remember when I was 21 years old and witnessed a dear friend get assaulted by her boyfriend.  He and I played tug-o-war with her body as he tried to drag her down my apartment stairs, eventually pulling her out of my grasp. My then-boyfriend did nothing&#8211; &#8220;It&#8217;s none of our business&#8221;, he said. The next day she apologized to me (yes, SHE apologized) and I hugged her and asked her why doesn’t she “just leave”. She told me it wasn’t that simple and for the life of me I couldn’t understand why it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise and humiliation when I found myself in a full fledged abusive relationship by the time I was 30. Humiliation because I was embarrassed to be “weak” and surprise because I couldn’t pinpoint when and how exactly I got HERE.  I remember feeling both one particular night as I picked up all of my belongings and my pride from my abuser&#8217;s backyard during a quiet snowfall. What I can tell you about abuse is, the world looks so much different from the inside of a snow globe.</p>
<p>When you’re on the outside looking in, it’s so easy to say what you would do if you were in a particular situation. It’s so easy to judge someone for their decisions if we haven’t had to face those same decisions ourselves. I’m not just talking about abuse. I’m talking about people struggling through any type of hardship: trauma, addiction, depression, financial strain, grief, heartbreak, etc. So many people are suffering in silence because the coulda/shouldas from the people they love are too loud.</p>
<p>I was 30 years old when I realized I wasn’t the friend my friend needed me to be one fateful moment nine years earlier. And it wasn’t until I was standing on the other side of a very quiet and lonely snow globe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 4/5/19, I resigned from my job&#8211;a job I loved&#8211; as a Domestic Violence Victim Advocate with a local prosecution office.  This, after being reprimanded for “empowering a victim too much” and being told my job was “not to empower or make them feel whole, but to get them to do what the prosecutor tells them to do”.  My heart pounded as I typed my resignation letter, even more so as I walked down the long hall to my supervisor&#8217;s office to turn it in.  Still, in my heart, I knew I was doing the right thing.  You know how the saying goes&#8211; &#8220;If you don&#8217;t stand for something&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I immediately started a job with a personal injury firm, a field I didn’t have experience in, and was absolutely miserable.  So miserable, in fact, that I would have to pray before walking through the doors and again when I left. That didn’t last long, as they told me they overestimated their budget and couldn’t afford a full time person, let alone one that they had to train. I was let go and later found out I was ineligible to receive unemployment benefits because I was just shy a few days of the required length of employment.</p>
<p>For the last 4 months I have been unemployed and not for lack of trying to find work. This was new to me as I’ve NEVER had trouble finding a job before and I’ve never had to solely depend on someone else to make ends meet. But, not only was I unemployed, I was unemployed while running a non-profit organization where people rely on me for help daily. Watching my husband break his back to hold our family down and not being able to help him, and having to turn away new clients because I couldn’t help them, while STILL trying to help the clients we already had&#8230;I was beyond stressed. But more than that, I was humbled.</p>
<p>On 9/3, I will start my new job in advocacy with another city prosecution office— a job my daughter convinced me to apply for.  My commute time is 4 min each way! I will get off earlier during the week and have off on Fridays, allowing me the extra time I’ve grown accustomed to having for my family and G.R.O.W. Later next month I’ll be in Phoenix for the first time for a huge DV conference and I imagine the opportunities will continue to go up from there.</p>
<p>I learned so much during these last 4 months! I was reminded that it’s ok to need, ask for, and accept help. That there are people who will truly hold you down, even when they don’t know that they are. That God just wants you to sit your ass down sometimes and rest. And last but not least, having the right person(s) by your side as you ride through the storm is everything. My husband and my family is everything. Someone recently asked me if I regret turning in my resignation letter that day in April. I don’t. I regret doubting for even one second whether we would be ok once I did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I arrived late at night, maybe around 10 or 11, and checked myself into the E.R. I remember it was cold outside, or maybe it was cold inside the waiting room, or maybe it was just cold inside of me. Whatever it was, the small leather jacket I was wearing did little to keep the chill out of the air. I stared down at my ballet flats as the intake nurse checked my blood pressure and other vitals. &#8220;What brings you here tonight, hon?&#8221;, she asked absentmindedly&#8211;head down,pen poised above her chart. &#8220;I&#8230;um&#8230;I got into a fight with my boyfriend.&#8221; Her eyes jumped up, forcing mine to stop playing double-dutch with everything in the room and focus on her. &#8220;What exactly do you mean by fighting?&#8221;, she asked evenly. I sighed, fidgeting with the zipper on the jacket that refused to keep out the cold and answered, &#8220;We were just wrestling. It&#8217;s really no big deal.&#8221; She stared at me for a second, holding my gaze while I tried to hold onto my sanity. &#8220;Do you want me to call the police?&#8221; You would have thought she&#8217;d just offered to set my hair on fire the way I reacted. &#8220;No. No! Please. I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; She closed her chart, smiling for the sake of saying she did it, and walked me to an empty room. &#8220;The doctor will be with you shortly&#8230;&#8221;, she says as she quietly closes the door between her pity and my shame. I sat in the empty room; alternating between the bed and the only chair in the room, when a knock interrupted the silence. A police officer walked in, assessing me like the last crime scene he&#8217;d laid his patience down for. The sharp pain in my ribs was suddenly diluted by the pain of my humiliation and fear. &#8220;I need a name&#8221;, he said tersely. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do that&#8221;, I countered. He let out an exasperated breath, rubbing his temples with his left hand. His wedding ring catching the fluorescent lighting in the too cold room. &#8220;Yes, you can. This&#8230; this will just get worse&#8221;. I stubbornly shook my head and told him I couldn&#8217;t (or wouldn&#8217;t) do it. He asked me why I wouldn&#8217;t leave, why I believed I deserved to be treated this way. I felt my fear jump double-dutch with his frustrations and my broken heart, yet still believed it was easier than facing the unknown. &#8220;Because, Officer&#8230;I have nowhere else to go. When I leave here I have to go back there.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago I reached out to my ex, the abuser, and told him I’d like to see him face to face. I wasn’t sure if he’d have the same number and my heart was pounding so hard that I almost didn’t send the text. He responded almost immediately; saying it was nice to hear from me and that it would be good to see me. Meanwhile, I could almost taste my rage. A rage I hadn’t expected to be there. We made arrangements to meet in the parking lot of a local mall the next day and I could barely sleep. The next morning he called and asked if I was sure I wanted to meet. Further stating that he didn’t want to upset me, how I’ve always been a “good girl” and that he hasn’t had a “real” relationship since we ended. I assured him that seeing him face to face was something that I definitely wanted to do and confirmed the time again. An hour before our meeting he texted me and asked if my boyfriend or husband knew we were meeting and if he was ok with it. I responded, “My husband is aware and he knows this is something I need to do.” Two minutes later he texted back that he didn’t think a meeting was a good idea and told me to take care of myself. I was so angry that all I could do was laugh. Maybe he thought this was a set up for my husband to confront him or something but it was nothing of the sort. It was for ME. I needed the person who mentally tore me down almost to the point of no return to look me in my eyes. I needed to see the person who inflicted physical pain over and over, leaving bruises (and medical bills along with it) to see me standing stronger than ever. I needed to see him for every time I was called a worthless bitch, for every time I was hit or strangled, for every time I wanted to die. For every time I could have. I was pissed. How dare he, after giving me all that shit he used to say I asked for, not give me the one thing I needed?</p>
<p>I needed him to see he didn’t break me.</p>
<p>But you know what? I realize now that my husband was right. My friends were right. My family, too. He doesn’t owe me. I owe me! I owe it to myself to continue to be this bad ass woman that I have become. I owe it to me to embrace the love that I have for myself, inside and out. I am HAPPY and you know what? I deserve to be. I can’t lie. Deep down, part of me still hopes to run into him one day. When or if I do, I don’t know what I will say. But the difference between two years ago and today is, I realize the person who deserves to know I’m not broken is me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was out for an evening with friends the other night when I, as many of us do, found myself absentmindedly scrolling through Facebook. As I skimmed through funny jokes, dramatic rants and annoying ads, I scrolled past a picture that made me stop in my tracks. It was him. Mr. “I’ll never get on Facebook” had finally done just that and the ever so &#8220;social&#8221; media site thought it was a good idea to let me know that he did. “____________ is someone you may know.” I sat still as a mixture of shock, wonder and rage trickled through my veins like liquid bullets shot from the triggers of my past. Of COURSE I know him. Of course I know the person that singlehandedly broke me&#8230;ahem, almost broke me&#8230; yet strengthened me beyond my wildest dreams. Of course I know the person that taught me how to love and hate at the same time, no matter if I was looking at his reflection or mine. Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know the person who tried to bury my spirit beneath the ground I now dance on effortlessly. Thank God I did know him because had I not, I wouldn’t know the survivor journey that would eventually lead me to my beautiful husband, the creation of this amazing organization and the countless priceless friends I have made along the way.  I wouldn&#8217;t know ME.  Thanks for the reminder, Facebook.  Signed, Someone He Used To Know.</p>

I was tempted to throw it away at the end of my shift but opted to keep it instead, even at the risk of him finding it.  &#8220;You what?&#8221;, I thought to myself.  &#8220;F#% it.  When is the last time I received flowers, real or otherwise, anyway?&#8221;  These thoughts and others like it swam through my head as I placed the makeshift flower on the dashboard of my ancient Ford Explorer.</p>
<p>It was no surprise that he found the rose nor that when he did, he tore it apart.  And me.  Petals made of paper, tears and a broken heart lay on the floor between us.  It&#8217;s stem, as wilted and paper thin as my backbone, folded itself in half as if wishing it were invisible.  I folded inside myself and became invisible.  The next time I saw the older gentleman he asked how I was doing and if I still had the flower.  I smiled and told him the rose was doing just fine.</p>
