<p id="ZR2GM6LFQNED3PMZFA7CIBYY3I" class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left">Asking survivors of domestic violence to get a restraining order or go to a shelter or hotel was not practical, said <a href="https://growinganewheart.org/team/jac-patrissi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JAC Patrissi</a>, a trauma clinician, author and founder of Growing a New Heart, a collective of professionals who work on issues including domestic violence and social justice. “People were looking for ways to address the spike in intimate partner violence under the conditions we were facing,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Caroline Love, Kera News: It takes less pressure on the neck to knock out a victim of domestic violence than it does to crack an egg. And death can come very quickly.</p>
<p>Impeding someone’s breath or circulation can be a felony under <a class="Link" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas law.</a> It can be hands on the neck, a pillow over the face, even a forearm pressed against the windpipe — all of those are considered attempted strangulation in domestic violence circles.</p>
<p>Janet Langbein from Genesis Women’s Shelter in Dallas says four pounds of compression on an airway can knock someone out in a few seconds. More than a minute can be fatal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man who says he was stalked for months is sharing his story.</p>
<p>Jonathan DeCastro told News 3 that the stalking he suffered began in 2019 when he still lived in Newport News. Although he wasn&#8217;t with his partner for long, the stalking began when they broke up.</p>
<p>Neisha Himes, the CEO of <a class="Link" href="http://growfoundationva.org/">GROW</a>, an organization that helps domestic violence victims, said she sees cases like this often.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked with at least 50 to 60% stalking cases,&#8221; Himes said. &#8220;[They can range from] harassing phone calls, or a GPS tracker being placed into [the victim&#8217;s] vehicle unwanted.&#8221;</p>
